<meta itemprop="description" content="Parents&#39; neighborhood choices shape children’s economic opportunities in the United States. However, most children raised in bottom-quality neighborhoods still live in low-quality neighborhoods in adulthood. Could parents&#39; neighborhood choices also affect their children&rsquo;s future choices? I develop a quantitative spatial model of parental decisions that incorporates a novel mechanism: social learning about the technology of skill formation. Segregation generates information frictions that systematically distort parents&#39; subjective beliefs and behavior. Using several United States representative datasets, I calibrate the model to the average commuting zone in the country. The calibrated model matches targeted and non-targeted parental behaviors and generates an endogenous distribution of subjective beliefs. I find that a relatively modest level of delusion increases inequality by 3% and decreases social mobility by 12%. Housing vouchers improve the neighborhood quality of eligible families, raising children&rsquo;s future earnings. When scaled-up, general equilibrium responses in local prices and subjective beliefs amplify the policy effects on eligible households, reducing inequality and improving social mobility. Ignoring subjective belief responses greatly undermines the policy effects."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2021-04-03T00:00:00+00:00" />

<p><strong>Could parents' neighborhood choices also affect their children&rsquo;s future choices?</strong></p>
<p>I propose a novel mechanism: social learning about the technology of skill formation in the neighborhood.</p>
<table>
<caption>Social learning in the Neighborhood</caption>
<tr><td><div class="f6"> Consider a world in which success depends on parental inputs -- neighborhood quality and parental time-- and ability shocks.
<p>Information is imperfect; people are unaware of the returns to parental inputs and must learn about it. Young adults learn by observing older adults in their neighborhoods (social learning). They see average local successes and past parental inputs but only perceive their neighbors' ability shocks.</p>
<p>Young adults' inference of the returns crucially depends on the accuracy of their perception. If they underestimate local ability shocks, they implicitly attribute too little of the local successes to those shocks and become over-optimistic about the returns to parental inputs. Conversely, if they overestimate them, they become pessimistic about the returns.</p>
<p>Ability shock perceptions are unbiased but bounded, which leads to moderate perceptions of ability shocks. Therefore, the larger the ability shocks in a given neighborhood, the more young adults underestimate local ability shocks and become over-optimistic. Conversely, the smaller the ability shocks in a given neighborhood, the more young adults overestimate local ability shocks and become pessimistic.</p>
<p>With residential income segregation, persistent delusion arises endogenously. In high-quality neighborhoods, live, on average, over-optimistic and wealthy parents with high-ability shocks. Their children become over-optimistic and tend to stay. In low-quality neighborhoods live, on average, pessimistic and low-income parents with low-ability shocks. Their children become pessimistic and tend to stay.  </div ></td></tr></p>

<p>I use the calibrated model to evaluate a housing voucher policy. In line with empirical evidence, the model predicts that housing vouchers improve the neighborhood quality of eligible families, raising children&rsquo;s future earnings. When scaling up the policy to 10% of the lowest income families, general equilibrium responses in local prices and subjective beliefs amplify the effects on eligible households, reducing inequality and improving social mobility. Ignoring subjective belief responses significantly undermines the housing voucher policy effects.</p>
