<meta itemprop="description" content="By choosing neighborhoods in which to live, parents affect future economic outcomes of their children. Nevertheless, low-income families who benefit from housing vouchers tend to remain in low-opportunity areas. While empirical evidence suggests that affordability and moving costs do not fully explain this pattern, in this paper I will argue that this phenomenon can results from local information transmission about returns on parental investment. After presenting empirical evidence of local transmission of information, I develop and calibrate a spatial equilibrium model of an average commuting zone with multiple neighborhoods, families and imperfect information about returns on parental investment. In this model, adults&#39; human capital is determined by two parental investment choices (neighborhood and time) and by one exogenous luck shock. During childhood, agents learn about returns on parental investment using information at the local level. Under the assumption that children do not know the local distribution of the luck shock, this model displays persistent delusion that is correlated with earnings. The calibrated model captures empirical patterns regarding the correlation between parental investment and education, intergenerational mobility and residential choices. Place based policies that decrease neighborhood quality heterogeneity and segregation within a commuting zone substantially improve intergenerational mobility."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2021-04-03T00:00:00+00:00" />

        <p><strong>Abstract</strong>:</p>
<p>Neighborhoods in the US shape future economics outcomes of children who grow up in them, and their endogenous demographic composition define who are the role models for those children. I develop and estimate a structural spatial equilibrium model of parental investments in which residential choices exogenously impact the human capital formation of children, and endogenously shape their expectations about the returns to educational investments. Under the assumption that agents are unable to perfectly estimate the bias that spatial sorting introduces, this model generates persistent misbeliefs about returns to educational investment that are correlated with earnings. The estimated model captures empirical patterns regarding the correlation between subjective beliefs and earnings, intergenerational mobility and residential choices. A housing quota policy that would allow disadvantaged children to live in a more favorable neighborhood would have a positive effect on human capital and expectations of the beneficiaries due to improved local human capital formation and demographic composition. However, relatively low and sticky beliefs about returns to educational investments dampen the effect on intergenerational mobility.</p>
