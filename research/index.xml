      <title>Employment Transitions: Mechanisms For Gender Earnings Gap </title>

      <description>We use German administrative data to compare women&amp;rsquo;s and men&amp;rsquo;s career choices and labor income profiles over their working lives. We find a significant and robust gender gap in job-to-job transitions. When working full-time, women are less likely than men to transition from one employer to another. The first finding is that while commuting preferences and sector selection do not explain this gap, the birth event largely explains it. Second, we want to quantify the consequences of the gender gap in job-to-job transitions for the gender earnings gap. If full-time job-to-job transitions increase wage growth, this phenomenon most likely contributes to the well-documented child penalty.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Cash Transfers in Togo: Digital Data Do Not Recover Treatment Effects Found in Survey Data</title>

      <description>Digital cash transfer programs were setup rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic and are increasingly common post-pandemic. In a randomized evaluation, we find that Togo&amp;rsquo;s Novissi program, which identified beneficiaries using poverty proxied by mobile phone data and provided US$13-15 in monthly mobile cash transfers, yielded modestly positive, statistically significant treatment effects on self-reported food security, financial health, and mental health. However, mobile phone data records, previously successful at predicting poverty levels, do not generate similar treatment effects to the survey data. Our results have key implications for using mobile phone data as a proxy for vulnerability in policy impact measurement.</description>

      <title>Why Don&#39;t Poor Families Move? A Spatial Equilibrium Analysis of Parental Decisions with Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://suzannebellue.github.io/research/neighborhoods/</link>

      <description>In the United States, childhood neighborhood quality shapes adulthood economic opportunities. However, most children raised in bottom-quality neighborhoods still live in low-quality neighborhoods in adulthood. Could childhood neighborhood directly affect adulthood choices? I develop a quantitative spatial model of parental decisions that incorporates a novel mechanism: social learning about the technology of skill formation. Segregation generates information frictions that systematically distort parents&#39; subjective beliefs and behavior. I calibrate the model using several United States representative datasets. The calibrated model matches targeted and non-targeted parental behavior and generates an endogenous distribution of subjective beliefs. I find a relatively modest level of delusion that increases inequality by 3% and decreases intergenerational mobility by  12%. A housing voucher policy improves the neighborhood quality of eligible families, raising children&amp;rsquo;s future earnings. When scaling up the policy, long-run and general equilibrium responses in subjective beliefs amplify the policy effects. Inequality reduces, and intergenerational mobility improves.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning and Mobile Phone Data Can Improve the Targeting of Humanitarian Assistance</title>
      <link>https://suzannebellue.github.io/research/targeting/</link>

      <description>Targeting is a central challenge in the administration of anti-poverty programs: given available data, how does one rapidly identify the individuals and families with the greatest need? Here we show that non-traditional “big” data from satellites and mobile phone networks can improve the targeting of anti-poverty programs. Our analysis compares outcomes – including exclusion errors, total social welfare, and measures of fairness – under different targeting regimes. Relative to other feasible targeting options, the machine learning approach reduces errors of exclusion by 4-21%. These results highlight the potential for new data sources to contribute to humanitarian response efforts, particularly in crisis settings when traditional data are missing or out of date.</description>

      <title>Teacher Training Program, Teacher Practices and Student Performance in Science: Evidence from a Randomized Study in French Primary Schools</title>
      <link>https://suzannebellue.github.io/research/teacher-training/</link>

      <description>We conduct a randomized study to assess the impact of an in-service teacher training program on inquiry-based learning in science in French primary schools. The study comprises 134 randomly assigned volunteer teachers and two cohorts of about 2,500 students. In addition to student test scores, we collect information on teacher practices and pedagogical knowledge. We find that the training program (80 hours over two years) increases the weekly hours of science instruction as well as the number of science experiments conducted in class. Yet, one year later, most of these effects disappear. Consistently, while we find small effects on students’ scientific knowledge during the last year of the training program, these effects are also short-lived. These results highlight the difficulty to train experienced teachers in a way that has deep and long-lasting influence on their practices.</description>

      <title>Impacts of a Multi-component Reading Intervention for 6th-grade Students: Results from a Clustered Randomized Controlled Trial</title>

      <description>This study aimed to design, implement and analyze the effectiveness of a multicomponent reading comprehension intervention for sixth-grade students with reading difficulties. We conducted a clustered randomized study with 21 French middle schools. In ten of them, teachers have implemented fluency workshops and explicit comprehension instruction. We measure the impact on 568 target students, and show no statistically significant effect of the intervention. The lack of statistical effects contrasts with observations indicating that, overall, the school leaders and the teachers declared to be satisfied with the proposed device and the actions conducted. However, our results align with a growing research base showing that setting up additional support and disseminating research tools is not enough to observe real progress in students’ performance. Indeed, our field observations revealed significant implementation difficulties.</description>
