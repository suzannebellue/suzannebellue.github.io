      <description>Neighborhoods in the US shape future economics outcomes of children who grow up in them, and their endogenous demographic composition define who are the role models for those children. I develop and estimate a structural spatial equilibrium model of parental investments in which residential choices exogenously impact the human capital formation of children, and endogenously shape their expectations about the returns to educational investments.</description>

      <description>We conduct a large randomized study to assess the impact of an in-service teacher training program on inquiry-based teaching in sciences. The randomized study is conducted in several French primary schools, comprises randomly assigned 134 teachers and two cohorts of about 2500 students. In addition to standardized student test score, we collect information on teacher quantitative and qualitative practices and pedagogical knowledge. We find that the training program (80 hours over 2 years) significantly increase the weekly hours of science as well as the number of hands-on science experiments conducted in class.</description>
