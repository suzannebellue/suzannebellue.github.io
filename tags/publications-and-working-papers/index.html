    <p class="f6 lh-copy mb2 ">In the United States, less-educated parents tend to allocate little time to parent-child activities, reside in disadvantaged neighborhoods, and underestimate the relevance of parental inputs for later outcomes. This paper introduces a social learning mechanism that can explain socioeconomic differences in parental beliefs and decisions. The mechanism posits that young adults learn by observing older people in their neighborhood but are prone to misinferences as they imperfectly correct for selection induced by residential segregation. I incorporate this social learning mechanism in an overlapping generations model of residential and parental time decisions. Once calibrated to the United States, the model accurately captures both targeted and non-targeted parental behavior across socioeconomic groups. Parental beliefs have sizable effects on the economy, increasing income inequality by 3% (income Gini index) and decreasing social mobility by 15% (income rank-rank coefficient). The general equilibrium effects of housing vouchers hinge on their ability to reduce residential segregation. Greater effectiveness in reducing segregation leads to larger gains in welfare, income, and social mobility, but also extends the transition to a new steady state.</p>

    <p class="f6 lh-copy mb2 ">We study the long-run macroeconomic, distributional, and intergenerational effects of school tracking—the allocation of students to different types of schools—by incorporating school track decisions into a general-equilibrium heterogeneous-agent overlapping-generations model. The key ingredient in the model is the child skill production technology, where a child’s skill development depends on her peers and the instruction pace in her school track. We show analytically that this technology can rationalize reduced-form evidence on the effects of school tracking on the distribution of child skills. We then calibrate the model using representative data from Germany, a country with a very early school tracking policy. Our calibrated model predicts that an education reform that postpones the tracking age from ten to fourteen generates sizable improvements in intergenerational mobility but comes at the cost of modest losses in aggregate human capital and economic output, reducing aggregate welfare. This efficiency-mobility trade-off is rooted in the effects of longer comprehensive schooling on child learning and depends crucially on the presence of general equilibrium effects in the labor market. Finally, our calibrated model predicts that policies reducing the parental influence in the school track choice increase both social mobility and aggregate economic output, improving aggregate welfare.</p>

    <p class="f6 lh-copy mb2 ">Do non-traditional digital trace data and traditional survey data yield similar estimates of the impact of a cash transfer program? In a randomized controlled trial of Togo’s COVID-19 Novissi program, endline survey data indicate positive treatment effects on beneficiary food security, mental health, and self-perceived economic status. However, impact estimates based on mobile phone data —processed with machine learning to predict beneficiary welfare— do not yield similar results, even though related data and methods do accurately predict wealth and consumption in prior cross-sectional analysis in Togo. This limitation likely arises from the underlying difficulty of using mobile phone data to predict short-term changes in wellbeing within a rural population with fairly homogeneous baseline levels of poverty. We discuss the implications of these results for using new digital data sources in impact evaluation.</p>

    <p class="f6 lh-copy mb2 ">Although in-service teacher training programs are designed to enhance the performance of several cohorts of students, there is little evidence on the persistence of their effects. We present the two-year results of a randomized study of an intensive in-service teacher training program conducted in France during and after the training program’s implementation. Our results highlight the short-run effectiveness of the training program: it successfully improves students’ performance but only during the implementation year. A detailed analysis of teachers’ outcomes indicates that teachers changed their pedagogical vision and practices but afterward struggled to apply skills to contents not directly covered during training.</p>

    <p class="f6 lh-copy mb2 ">Targeting is a central challenge in the administration of anti-poverty programs: given available data, how does one rapidly identify the individuals and families with the greatest need? Here we show that non-traditional “big” data from satellites and mobile phone networks can improve the targeting of anti-poverty programs. Our analysis compares outcomes – including exclusion errors, total social welfare, and measures of fairness – under different targeting regimes. Relative to other feasible targeting options, the machine learning approach reduces errors of exclusion by 4-21%. These results highlight the potential for new data sources to contribute to humanitarian response efforts, particularly in crisis settings when traditional data are missing or out of date.</p>
