      <title>Residential and Social Mobility: A Quantitative Analysis of Parental Decisions with Social Learning</title>

      <description>In the United States, less-educated parents tend to allocate little time to parent-child activities, reside in disadvantaged neighborhoods, and underestimate the relevance of parental inputs for later outcomes. This paper introduces a social learning mechanism that can explain socioeconomic differences in parental beliefs and decisions. The mechanism posits that young adults learn by observing older people in their neighborhood but are prone to misinferences as they imperfectly correct for selection induced by residential segregation. I incorporate this social learning mechanism in an overlapping generations model of residential and parental time decisions. Once calibrated to the United States, the model accurately captures both targeted and non-targeted parental behavior across socioeconomic groups. Parental beliefs have sizable effects on the economy, increasing income inequality by 3% (income Gini index) and decreasing social mobility by 15% (income rank-rank coefficient). The general equilibrium effects of housing vouchers hinge on their ability to reduce residential segregation. Greater effectiveness in reducing segregation leads to larger gains in welfare, income, and social mobility, but also extends the transition to a new steady state.</description>

      <title>Macroeconomic Consequences of Early Education Tracking</title>
      <link>https://suzannebellue.github.io/research/tracking/</link>

      <description>We study the long-run macroeconomic, distributional, and intergenerational effects of school tracking&amp;mdash;the allocation of students to different types of schools&amp;mdash;by incorporating school track decisions into a general-equilibrium heterogeneous-agent overlapping-generations model. The key ingredient in the model is the child skill production technology, where a childâ€™s skill development depends on her peers and the instruction pace in her school track. We show analytically that this technology can rationalize reduced-form evidence on the effects of school tracking on the distribution of child skills. We then calibrate the model using representative data from Germany, a country with a very early school tracking policy. Our calibrated model predicts that an education reform that postpones the tracking age from ten to fourteen generates sizable improvements in intergenerational mobility but comes at the cost of modest losses in aggregate human capital and economic output, reducing aggregate welfare. This efficiency-mobility trade-off is rooted in the effects of longer comprehensive schooling on child learning and depends crucially on the presence of general equilibrium effects in the labor market. Finally, our calibrated model predicts that policies reducing the parental influence in the school track choice increase both social mobility and aggregate economic output, improving aggregate welfare.</description>

      <title>Private Information in the Family</title>

      <description>We theoretically and empirically investigate the hypothesis that private information plays a role within families. While standard theory implies that changes in relative income do not affect relative consumption in couples, we find a positive relationship in Dutch panel data. We collected data on how spouses share information with each other within the same panel and split our sample into those couples that are fully informed about each other&amp;rsquo;s income and those that are not. We find that the positive relationship between income and consumption shares is entirely driven by those couples that are not fully informed about each other&amp;rsquo;s income. This holds true when adding couple fixed effects, so that, indeed, a change in relative income within a given couple affects their consumption sharing. These findings are consistent with an optimal contracting model with private information. In the model, to provide incentives to share information with each other, the spouse who receives an income increase gets a larger promised utility, which is isomorphic to an increase in the bargaining weight. These findings suggest that information asymmetries are more relevant for families than previously believed.</description>

      <title>Employment Transitions: Mechanisms for Gender Earnings Gap </title>
      <link>https://suzannebellue.github.io/research/gender/</link>

      <description>We use German administrative data to compare women&amp;rsquo;s and men&amp;rsquo;s career choices and labor income profiles over their working lives. We find a significant and robust gender gap in job-to-job transitions. When working full-time, women are less likely than men to transition from one employer to another. The first finding is that while commuting preferences and sector selection do not explain this gap, the birth event largely explains it. Second, we want to quantify the consequences of the gender gap in job-to-job transitions for the gender earnings gap. If full-time job-to-job transitions increase wage growth, this phenomenon most likely contributes to the well-documented child penalty.</description>
