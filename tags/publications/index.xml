      <title>Estimating Impact with Surveys versus Digital Traces: Evidence from Randomized Cash Transfers in Togo</title>

      <description>We study whether program impacts can be estimated using a combination of digital trace data and machine learning. In a randomized controlled trial of cash transfers in Togo, endline survey data indicate positive treatment effects on food security, mental health, and perceived economic status. However, estimates of impact based solely on predicted endline outcomes (generated using trace data and machine learning, which do successfully predict baseline poverty) are generally not statistically significant. When post-treatment outcome data are used in conjunction with predictions to estimate treatment effects, predicted impacts are similar to those estimated using surveys.</description>

      <title>When Effective Teacher Training Falls Short in the Classroom: Evidence from an Experiment in Primary Schools</title>

      <description>Although in-service teacher training programs are designed to enhance the performance of several cohorts of students, there is little evidence on the persistence of their effects. We present the two-year results of a randomized study of an intensive in-service teacher training program conducted in France during and after the training program&amp;rsquo;s implementation. Our results highlight the short-run effectiveness of the training program: it successfully improves students&amp;rsquo; performance but only during the implementation year. A detailed analysis of teachers&amp;rsquo; outcomes indicates that teachers changed their pedagogical vision and practices but afterward struggled to apply skills to contents not directly covered during training.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning and Mobile Phone Data Can Improve the Targeting of Humanitarian Assistance</title>

      <description>Targeting is a central challenge in the administration of anti-poverty programs: given available data, how does one rapidly identify the individuals and families with the greatest need? Here we show that non-traditional “big” data from satellites and mobile phone networks can improve the targeting of anti-poverty programs. Our analysis compares outcomes – including exclusion errors, total social welfare, and measures of fairness – under different targeting regimes. Relative to other feasible targeting options, the machine learning approach reduces errors of exclusion by 4-21%. These results highlight the potential for new data sources to contribute to humanitarian response efforts, particularly in crisis settings when traditional data are missing or out of date.</description>
