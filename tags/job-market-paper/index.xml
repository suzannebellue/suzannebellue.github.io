      <description>United States parents shape their children&amp;rsquo;s economic opportunities by choosing their neighborhood quality. But children raised in bottom-quality neighborhoods tend to choose low-quality neighborhoods in adulthood. I develop a quantitative spatial model of parental decisions that incorporates a novel mechanism: community learning about the skill formation technology. Segregation generates information frictions that systematically distort parents&#39; subjective beliefs and behavior. The calibrated model helps understand parental behavior across socioeconomic groups. Under perfect information, inequality decreases by 1%, and social mobility increases by 13%. Housing vouchers improve neighborhood quality and earnings of eligible children. However, at scale, the policy backfires, increasing inequality.</description>
